# Real Words
Simple algorithm to devine the legitimacy of a submitted email from a form

A customer was receiving a ton of emails with the typical garbage.

Initially I added a simple session to throttle the emails down. And that was effective at lowering the volume, but wasn't ideal.

I knew about real word algorithms but only found classes. I didn't see any simple solutions...so I wrote one.

It took about 5 minutes and it has thus far been effective.
